Taylor: The Tea.
000000000000
Patrick: What?
000000000000
Taylor: It's the only option the murder weapon must have been-
000000000000
Police Officer: Sir.
000000000000
Patrick: What is it Carl?
000000000000
Officer Carl: Officer Ledu Dawn sent me to report to you about his findings:
000000000000
Patrick: Continue.
000000000000
Officer Carl: I've got the list of everything but most importantly is this schedule.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Apparently Mr. Woods was very particular about his tea.
000000000000
Officer Carl: He had a certain kind of tea at specific times in specific places.
000000000000
Officer Carl: This allows us to confirm the crime scene,
000000000000
Officer Carl: as the schedule lists that he would always have a specific tea in his study at 3:00.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Therefore if he died when we speculated that he died, he must have died in the study.
000000000000
Patrick: Carl is there anything else you can tell us about that tea schedule.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Well when I first saw this thing I said something along the lines of:
000000000000
Officer Carl: "You've got to be kidding me."
000000000000
Officer Carl: because it's got to be one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
000000000000
Officer Carl: One of the maids passing by laughed before saying that she had worked here for 10 years,
000000000000
Officer Carl: and she had never seen the old man deviate from his schedule once.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Apparently it was one of the few things that he wanted done a specific way.
000000000000
Officer Carl: It's also how Francine Mei got her job.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Some of the maids were gossiping about it.
000000000000
Officer Carl: They said that she was able to make every single tea correctly on the first try.
000000000000
Patrick: Thanks Carl could you file that with the evidence.
000000000000
Patrick: And write up a report about the gossip you heard.
000000000000
Patrick:  Oh, and make sure to get me a copy.
000000000000
Officer Carl: Done and Done Sir.
000000000000
Officer Carl: I knew that you'd want a copy and for me to write a report. Here you go.
500000000000
EVIDENCE GET:      Tea Schedule
000000000000
Patrick: Thanks Carl. Also, Isn't it time for your break?
000000000000
Officer Carl: Yeah but I thought that you would want this now rather than later.
000000000000
Officer Carl: And there's no way I'm trusting Shawn with this. Anyway I'll see ya later Boss.
000000000000
Taylor: Well then, that just helps me prove it was the tea even more.
000000000000
Patrick: How so?
000000000000
Taylor: It does two things. 
000000000000
Taylor: It proves the tea could have been used as the murder weapon,
000000000000
Taylor: and it narrows the range of the suspects.
000000000000
Sophia: It proves the tea could be used as a weapon because it's a habit.
000000000000
Sophia: The perpetrator knew that Oak was going to drink the tea at specific time and place.
000000000000
Sophia: From there all they had to do was poison the tea.
000000000000
Sophia: At that point it was guaranteed that Oak would die.
000000000000
Patrick: Oh! And it narrows the range of possible suspects,
000000000000
Patrick: because only people who knew these habits could take advantage of them.
000000000000
Patrick: Meaning that the only possible suspects are those who live here, 
000000000000
Patrick: because I'm pretty sure that that monster of a schedule isn't common knowledge.
000000000000
Taylor: Exactly.
000000000000
Patrick took a radio from his belt.
000000000000
Patrick: Hey Dave. Could you get up here? I need you to take something to forensics.
000000000000
Officer Dave: Sure thing sir. What do you need me to grab?
000000000000
Patrick: The Tea Set and all the tea in it. 
000000000000
Patrick: Tell them to check for poison and to tell the docs doing the autopsy to check for the same.
000000000000
Officer Dave: No problem Sir. I'll be there in just a minute.
