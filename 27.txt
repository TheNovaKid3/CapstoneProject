Patrick: Thanks Soph, kid you guys were a big help.
000000000000
Sophia: No problem Pat, but do mind if we stay and see if there's anything else we can help with?
000000000000
Patrick: I don't mind in the slightest. You're insights are amazing sometimes.
000000000000
Taylor: Hey I was wondering. Who's the main suspect now?
000000000000
Taylor: Ms. Mei was only the suspect because it was her knife that was the murder weapon,
000000000000
Taylor: and it seemed like she was the only one that had the opportunity to do it, right?
000000000000
Patrick: No. Ms Mei is still the prime suspect.
000000000000
Patrick: While we now know that she didn't kill him with the knife,
000000000000
Patrick: it's still her knife and it's still in his body.
000000000000
Patrick: Adding to that fact is that she now has even more of an opportunity.
000000000000
Patrick: Sure, other people do so as well,
000000000000
Patrick: but Ms. Mei is the one who usually brews and delivers Mr. Woods his tea.
000000000000
Patrick: It even says so on the schedule. She had ample opportunity to poison. But...
000000000000
Taylor: That fishy feeling again?
000000000000
Patrick: Yep.
000000000000
Taylor: Looks like we've got a lot more investigating to do before we get to the bottom of this.
000000000000
Sophia: Taylor, These kind of crimes are never simple.
000000000000
Sophia: There's always more investigating to do.
000000000000
Sophia: But let's take a small break. What do you say Patrick?
000000000000
Patrick: Sure thing. We don't we go get lunch at...
000000000000
The case was far from over but it did feel like we had found one of the big pieces of the puzzle.
000000000000
But there was this uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach.
000000000000
At the time I thought it was probably nothing. 
000000000000
However, I've been taught to trust my instincts. 
000000000000
And my instinct told me with all the certainty of cold, hard fact: 
000000000000
Francine Mei was innocent and we needed to prove it.
